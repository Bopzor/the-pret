# Yet An Other Tea Timer

I am a big fan of teas 🍵. I drink a lot of them and I care about how long it must infuse and at what temperature 🫖.
I have already done that project twice:

- my first TypeScript [project](https://github.com/Bopzor/teaTime)
- my first mobile-app with flutter [project](https://github.com/Bopzor/the_pret)

I decided to make it again, using react-native with expo. The main reason is that I want to learn and apply Clean Architecture concepts and TDD discipline.

## Run it

**Requirements:**

- git
- node >= 14
- yarn >= 1.22.5
- Expo Go on your phone _it is possible to run the app in the browser, however, its full support is not guaranteed_

Clone this repo then run `yarn` inside the folder to install dependencies.

> _if you didn't know, `yarn` is the same as `yarn install`, but shorter_.

Run `yarn start` to start the project. Expo should display a QRCode in your terminal.

Scan this QRCode with the Expo Go application (_or press `w` to open it in your default browser_).
